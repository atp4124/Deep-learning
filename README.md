# Deep-learning

This repo will contain the labs done during the Deep Learning course taught by Efstratios Gavves at the University of Amsterdam.
- Under *'MLP_and_CNN'*, we implement **MLP** from scratch using only **Numpy**, then we move the implementation to **Pytorch** where we try to reach an accuracy of higher than 0.52 on CIFAR10. In the next parts, we implement Layer Normalisation from scratch in Pytorch and use **CNNs** (VGG with skip connections) to reach an accuracy of 0.79 on CIFAR10.

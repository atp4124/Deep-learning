# Deep-learning

This repo will contain the labs done during the Deep Learning course taught by Efstratios Gavves at the University of Amsterdam.
- Under *'MLP_and_CNN'*, we implement **MLP** from scratch using only **Numpy**, then we move the implementation to **Pytorch** where we try to reach an accuracy of higher than 0.52 on CIFAR10. In the next parts, we implement Layer Normalisation from scratch in Pytorch and use **CNNs** (VGG with skip connections) to reach an accuracy of 0.79 on CIFAR10.
- Under *'RNN_and_GCN'*, we implement **LSTMS** from scratch using Pytorch on a binary palindrome sequence in the first part. In the second part, we use the same code to generate text as a sequence to sequence model trained using text from Project Gutenberg.
